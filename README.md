# Particle-Swarm-Optimization-and-FM-FM-1-WV-Retrial-1-Queues-with-Catastrophes

## Introduction
This 9 investigation presents a novel approach to optimizing cost efficiency in cloud storage systems by 10 applying particle swarm optimization of the Markovian retrial queueing model in a generic setup 11 by incorporating the working vacation and usersâ€™ discouragement behaviour.
