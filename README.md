# Particle-Swarm-Optimization-and-FM-FM-1-WV-Retrial-1-Queues-with-Catastrophes

## Introduction
This repository contains optimizing cost efficiency in cloud storage systems by applying particle swarm optimization of the Markovian retrial queueing model using MATLAB.
## Overview
- **Goal:** Optimize cost values with service rates \mu_{1} & \mu_{2}.
- **Optimumizw:**
  - Objective function TC.
  - Service rates
  - Improved convergence speed.
